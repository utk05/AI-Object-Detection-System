# 🖼️ YOLOv8 Real-Time Object Detection with Tkinter UI

This project integrates **YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)** with **OpenCV** and a **Tkinter-based GUI** to perform **real-time object detection** using a webcam.  
It provides a simple desktop interface where users can view live detections with bounding boxes directly inside a Python GUI window.
